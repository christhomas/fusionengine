/*	RELEASE NOTES
	This program was rewritten by Chris Thomas<chris_thomas@hotmail.com> 2001

	**********************VERY IMPORTANT LICENCE INFORMATION*****************************
	The original code was also mangled to become part of an object TextureFont, derived
	from IFont which is the base of my font library code.  This code now becomes part of that
	but since I can't GPL it without permission, the following files are exempt from 
	the GPL licence applied to this library

	TextureFont.cpp
	TextureFont.h

	These files contain the original source code from Mark Kilgard, 
	I dont have his permission to alter his licence to be compatible,
	hence this rather long and tedious header
	**********************VERY IMPORTANT LICENCE INFORMATION*****************************

	It was rewritten to take advantage of the new developments of OpenGL

	1.	Texture objects are now the only method of storing the textures, since they are now
		practially standard. Any hardware that doesnt support them, I neither care about
		now give two shits if you can't run this code because of this decision :) hehe (joking)
		BUY NEW HARDWARE

	2.	Vertex arrays are now the method of rendering the quads, they are much faster and I was 
		able to integrate the vertex arrays nicely into the fusion engine this file should accompany.

	I've removed practically all the code I found to be useless, at least on this platform 
	(win32/nvidia gf2mx), however, if you	find that something quite reasonable has not been 
	done to support you, can you contact me and I'll help or code up that relevant support, I 
	dont have a problem with this, it's not exactly rocket science, so get in touch and I'll 
	see what I can do about supporting your hardware

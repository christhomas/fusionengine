/** @ingroup	Fusion_Group

 *
 *	This is how developers of fusion powered applications gain access
 *	to functionality provided.  The various sub-objects are not guarenteed
 *	to be valid objects, since whether they are valid or not, depends on whether
 *	a sub-object has been requested, for example.  Applications which dont need sound
 *	won't create a sound object, so therefore the sound object will be NULL and should
 *	be left alone.  Any attempt to access a subsystem which was not requested, 
 *	is met with an application crash, stupidity is not tolerated.
